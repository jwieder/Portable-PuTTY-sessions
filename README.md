# Portable-PuTTY-sessions
By default, the Windows SSH client PuTTY stores information about saved sessions on the registry of the local computer on which it is installed. This script will instead store that information within a directory of the user's choice - allowing session information to be stored on a portable encrypted drive. Assembled from PuTTY documentation.
